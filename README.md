# vhapi-example-pack
An example of most datapackable configs you can use with VHAPI.

Note that the datapack format changed slightly in VHAPI v2, you *must* put all of the vault configs inside of a vault_configs folder. You are no longer required to use the vhapi namespace, you can use whatever namespace you want. Make sure if you need to reference that namespace that you keep that in mind.

Check out each of the folders and you can get some more details about each of the configs and their possibilities and any caveats.
