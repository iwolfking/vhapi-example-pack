# Palettes
This is for registering palette files you have included under gen/palettes. 1.0 should be a Resource Location that matches with the path you have the file in. For example, if you have a palette under gen/palettes/rooms/example_room_palette.json then you should have "vhapi:rooms/example_room_palette" as your id.
