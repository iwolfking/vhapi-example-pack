# Template Pools
This is for registering template pool files you have included under gen/template_pools. 1.0 should be a Resource Location that matches with the path you have the file in. For example, if you have a template pool under gen/template_pools/test/example_pool.json then you should have "vhapi:test/example_pool" as your id.
