# Gen Files
These are files used in Vault Generation. At this time, they support adding new ones only. Replacing existing entries will be coming soon. Note that any file here will also need registered under the appropiate main config as well.

All files use the same format as found in gen/1.0/<type> in the_vault configs. When referencing a custom loot table, palette, theme, or template pool, make sure to use it's Resource Location id instead of a file path.
